# PaddysHeroStats — Project Hub

## What is PaddysHeroStats?

**Marvel Champions: The Card Game** is a cooperative LCG where players take on the roles of iconic Marvel heroes to battle against villains in scenario-driven games.  
While the game itself is amazing, many fans track their progress using spreadsheets, notebooks... or pure memory.

**PaddysHeroStats** is here to make that easier.

It's a personal stat tracker that helps players record matches, heroes used, villains faced, and other gameplay highlights — all in a clean and visual format.

> _This is a fan project, unaffiliated with Fantasy Flight Games or Marvel._
